Our method results in explicit equations for the $p$-th power and uses classical results of Serre and Swinnerton-Dyer about modular forms modulo $p$. From this, we verify that a general conjecture by Sheperd-Barron and Ekedahl is valid for the Ramanujan vector field. Furthermore, we consider the affine realization of a certain moduli space of elliptic curves where the Ramanujan vector field is defined, and describe - in characteristic $p$ - the locus given by supersingular elliptic curves in two ways: a classical one - using equations for the supersingular polynomial - and a new one as the singular set of some vector fields. Additionally, we prove that the Ramanujan vector field is transversal to this locus.","id":"2602.20109v1_On_the_Ramanujan_Vector_Field_modulo__p__1","extraction_method":"heuristic","status":"template","date":"2026-02-24","hour":"14:42"}

For various arithmetically interesting subsets $\\mathcal A\\subseteq [1, N]\\cap\\mathbb N$ such that the distribution of $\\sum_{n\\in \\mathcal A} f(n)$ is approximately Gaussian, we develop a general framework to understand the large fluctuations of the sum. This extends the general central limit theorem framework of Soundararajan and Xu.\n  In the case when $\\mathcal A = (N-H, N]$ is a short interval with admissible $H=H(N)$, we show that almost surely \\begin{equation*}\n  \\limsup_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\big\\lvert\\sum_{N-H<n\\leq N} f(n)\\big\\rvert}{\\sqrt{H\\log \\frac{N}H{}}}>0. \\end{equation*} When $\\mathcal A$ is the set of values of an admissible polynomial $P\\in\\mathbb Z[x]$, we extend work of Klurman, Shkredov, and Xu, as well as Chinis and the author, showing that almost surely \\begin{equation*}\n  \\limsup_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\big\\lvert\\sum_{n\\leq N} f(P(n))\\big\\rvert}{\\sqrt{N \\log\\log N}}>0, \\end{equation*} even when $P$ is a product of linear factors over $\\mathbb Q$. In this case, we also establish the corresponding almost sure upper bound, matching the law of iterated logarithm.\n  An important ingredient in our work is bounding the Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance by means of a quantitative martingale central limit theorem.","id":"2602.20086v1_Large_fluctuations_of_random_multiplicat_0","extraction_method":"heuristic","status":"template","date":"2026-02-24","hour":"15:17"}
