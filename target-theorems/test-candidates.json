Given two random permutations, what is the probability that they are comparable in the Bruhat order? This problem was first considered in a 2006 work of Hammett and Pittel, which showed an exponential lower bound and a polynomial upper bound. The lower bound was very recently improved to the subexponential bound of $\\exp(-n^{1/2 + o(1)})$ by Boretsky, Cornejo, Hodges, Horn, Lesnevich, and McAllister. Hammett and Pittel predicted that the probability should decrease polynomially. We show that the probability decreases faster than any polynomial and is on the order of $\\exp(-\u0398(\\log^2 n))$.",
