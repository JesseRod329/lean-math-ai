## Candidate Theorems

## Next Steps

1. Review formalized proofs in `proofs/2026-02-22/`
2. For proven: Clean up and consider submitting to mathlib4
3. For formalized (sorry): Fill in the proof tactics
4. For failed: Analyze Lean errors and fix syntax
5. For templates: Need better LLM or manual formalization
