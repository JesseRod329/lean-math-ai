/-- In a stochastic choice model, two distributions over choice rules are observationally equivalent if and only if they can be obtained from one another via a finite sequence of simple swapping transforms. We leverage this to obtain complete descriptions of both the defining inequalities and extreme points of these identified sets. -/
